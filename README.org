    Replaced clunky addSet feature by adding a WorkoutInstanceManager
    - WorkoutInstanceManager :: Essentially a cached version of the current WorkoutInstance. Allows modification for database IO, and retaining context on fragment navigation
    Use recyclerView for display of editTexts - with InputFilters to only allow #s
*** May 8th 2017
    Added workoutLogging functionality
    - WorkoutInstance :: Extends the workout type, but has a date associated with the workout
    - WorkoutInstanceExercise :: Extends Exercise, has a list of reps associated with it
    - DatabaseIO :: Allows storage of workout and workoutLogs as .json file on local file. Methods locally have a toJSONObject method

    Initial commit
    - Workout :: Consists a name, an arbitrary length list of exercises, and an arbitrary length list of associated tags
    - Exercise :: Consists of an ExerciseType, name and description
    - ExerciseType :: One of: MACHINE, BARBELL, DUMBELL, FREWEIGHT, CARDIO_MACHINE, CARDIO_FREE or UNDEFINED (\approx ERROR)
    Contains the necessary fragments for basic navigation
