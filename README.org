** Commits
*** May 27th 2017
    - Refactored project as GymRat (changed graphics accordingly)
    - Added NewWorkoutFragment, allowing user to create and add new workout
      - Requires a workout name, and at least 1 exercise
      - Exercise creation done by AlertDialog with immediate show override to maintain window if form not complete
      - Exercise reps addition by (finally) a reasonably elegant solution, using ViewHolder tag and getLayoutPosition
    - Added long-click menu for workout selection, replacing spinner with ListView
    - Timer toggle allows user to switch in between viewing exercises, and a rest timer with reset button fragment.

    Replaced clunky addSet feature by adding a WorkoutInstanceManager
    - WorkoutInstanceManager :: Essentially a cached version of the current WorkoutInstance. Allows modification for database IO, and retaining context on fragment navigation
    Use recyclerView for display of editTexts - with InputFilters to only allow #s
*** May 8th 2017
    Added workoutLogging functionality
    - WorkoutInstance :: Extends the workout type, but has a date associated with the workout
    - WorkoutInstanceExercise :: Extends Exercise, has a list of reps associated with it
    - DatabaseIO :: Allows storage of workout and workoutLogs as .json file on local file. Methods locally have a toJSONObject method

    Initial commit
    - Workout :: Consists a name, an arbitrary length list of exercises, and an arbitrary length list of associated tags
    - Exercise :: Consists of an ExerciseType, name and description
    - ExerciseType :: One of: MACHINE, BARBELL, DUMBELL, FREWEIGHT, CARDIO_MACHINE, CARDIO_FREE or UNDEFINED (\approx ERROR)
    Contains the necessary fragments for basic navigation
